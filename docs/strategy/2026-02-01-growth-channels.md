# CrankCase Growth Channels Strategy

## Executive Summary

CrankCase enters a market with established players (ProBikeGarage, VeloBuddy, MainTrack) but clear differentiation opportunities. The bike maintenance tracking space is characterized by:

- **Low awareness**: Most cyclists don't know these apps exist until they discover them through forums or word-of-mouth
- **Strava dependency**: Competitors rely heavily on Strava integration for user acquisition
- **Community-driven growth**: No competitor has cracked paid acquisition—all grow through organic community recommendations
- **Underserved niches**: Amateur racing teams, bike shop customers, and maintenance-focused content consumers are underexploited

The opportunity: Build authentic community presence in high-intent channels while competitors focus on passive Strava integration. Win through being genuinely helpful, not spammy.

## Recommended Starting Point

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Reddit Foundation**
- Focus exclusively on r/bikewrench and r/velo
- Goal: 10 helpful comments per week, zero product mentions
- Build credibility before any promotion

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): YouTube Outreach**
- Identify 5 micro-influencers (10-50k subscribers)
- Send personalized outreach with free premium offer
- Aim for 2 review videos

**Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): Local Shop Pilots**
- Partner with 3-5 shops in one market
- Test QR code cards and service integration
- Measure attribution

**Phase 4 (Month 4+): Scale What Works**
- Double down on highest-converting channels
- Add Strava club and team sponsorships
- Consider first paid experiments (YouTube sponsors)

---

## Channels NOT Recommended (Yet)

1. **Strava Sponsored Challenges**: $30-50k minimum, too early
2. **Facebook Ads**: Low intent, expensive for app installs
3. **Podcast Sponsorships**: Hard to track ROI, save for later
4. **GCN/GMBN partnerships**: Too expensive for current stage
5. **App Store Optimization**: Do it, but don't expect it to drive growth

---

## Key Principles

1. **Be a cyclist first, a marketer second**: Your 200+ miles/week gives you credibility—use it
2. **Help first, promote never**: The best growth is when others recommend you
3. **Solve real problems**: Every tactic should answer a question someone is already asking
4. **Track everything**: Use UTM codes, referral codes, and attribution to know what works
5. **Stay scrappy**: $0-500/month budget can outperform $10k/month with the right tactics

---

## Competitive Intelligence

**ProBikeGarage**: Grew through Strava integration and forum word-of-mouth. No paid marketing visible. 7+ years old, loyal user base, $2.99 one-time purchase.

**VeloBuddy**: Differentiates with ML-based maintenance predictions. Freemium model. Newer entrant.

**MainTrack**: Strong Strava sync, good UI. Competes on ease of use.

**Gap to exploit**: None of these competitors are actively building community. They wait for users to find them. CrankCase can win by being present where cyclists already discuss maintenance.
